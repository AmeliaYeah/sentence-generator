# sentence-generator

Simple python script which generates a random sentence based on what verbs/nouns/etc. are provided in the corresponding files. Also applies basic english logic, so that words are dynamically fitted to be more valid in terms of grammar. The sentences are nonsensical, which is both a "bug" and a feature, in that I didn't intend for it to be buggy (thanks to computers not understanding the nuance of human speech), but I also found it rather entertaining and decided to stick with it due to the unique gibberish it managed to generate.

Originally used for my [random meme generator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyK-hcEoqZGaYTosRT-rug) (now discontinued), but I figured that rather than deleting this it would probably serve better to fashion it as a more general-purpose library of sorts. Which would probably help when I move on to do more personal projects.

There might be a library that already does this, but if not, then here ya go. :)
