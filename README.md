# sentence-generator

Simple python script which generates a random sentence based on what verbs/nouns/etc. are provided in the corresponding files.

Originally used for my [random meme generator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyK-hcEoqZGaYTosRT-rug) (now discontinued), but I figured that rather than deleting this it would probably serve better to fashion it as a more general-purpose library of sorts. Which would probably help when I move on to do more personal projects.

There might be a library that already does this, but if not, then here ya go. :)
